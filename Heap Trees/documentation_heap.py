'''
Generally, Heaps can be of two types:
    Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it's children.
            --> The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
    Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it's children. 
            --> The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
